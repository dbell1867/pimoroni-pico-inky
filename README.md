##  PIMORONI Pico-Inky with PICO-W

Using CircuitPython to explore eink displays.  

Also, this project is to explore some of the concepts that I have learned regarding microcontrollers.  Specifically, I will use this to highlight the different ways of using time and delays and what effect that may have on the project.  Time monotonic, versus board time, versus internet time.
